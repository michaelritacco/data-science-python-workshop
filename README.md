# Data Science Python Workshop

Welcome to the Data Science Python Workshop GitHub repository!

This repository contains all the materials you will need to follow along with the workshop. Inside, you will find a [Data Science Python Workshop](https://github.com/michaelritacco/data-science-python-workshop/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Python%20Workshop.ipynb) Jupyter notebook, which includes code and explanations for each part of the workshop. Additionally, there is a [Data Science Python Workshop (Solutions Included)](https://github.com/michaelritacco/data-science-python-workshop/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Python%20Workshop%20(Solutions%20Included).ipynb) notebook available with solutions to all exercises, allowing you to check your work as you progress. Both notebooks are organized by topic for easy navigation.

In the main repoistory you will find the dataset required for the workshop. The dataset is used throughout the notebook and is essential for the data exploration and analysis exercises.

To get started, we recommend cloning or downloading this repository to your local machine. Running the notebooks requires Python and libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. Using a virtual environment for managing dependencies is suggested. Although installing Anaconda is optional, it can simplify setup significantly. Alternatively, if you prefer not to install anything locally, you can upload the notebook to Google Colab and follow along there.

This workshop includes hands-on exercises where you can modify the code and try out new approaches. If you have questions or run into issues, please open an issue in this repository.

We hope you find this repository helpful and enjoy the workshop!
